### Introduction
miniMUJI is an online shopping website for household appliances, inspired by the MUJI online store.

### Features and Future Development
I implemented full features for guests. Since I conducted this website in 2 weeks, I have not implemented the order review feature for customers, as well as customer and order management features for admins. In the future, I would like to implement full features for customer and admin roles, improve the front-end, and implement the MVC design pattern for this project.

### Accounts for login
You can register a new account or use the accounts below to test the features of customers and admins.
